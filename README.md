Open Source Auspicious Visual Overlay

A SSH 1106 OLED was used for the first tries (AZDelivery 1.3 Inch Oled)
The exact model of reflex scope i used was this one:

For people that use other optics i uploaded a calibrator with variable optical length, i never got to print it, so it maybe needs changes.
